<hr>

<h3>Ender's Game</h3>
<p>First Sci-Fi book that I ever read. Love the characters, especially Petra Arkanian.</p>

<p>Stephen King in his best version ever. Cannot decide whether book or movie adaptation is better.</p>

<p>Pop-culture book written by Jakub Cwiek about boys who don't want to grow up.</p>
