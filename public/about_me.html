<p>Hi! I'm Klaudia - once again, welcome on my first porfolio. I'm detail oriented, fast learning QA that always looks for some opportunity to develop new skills. That's why I'm creating this website during the web-development course.</p>
<p>But life is not only about the computers, isn't it? In my free time I'm writing many short stories, mostly inspired by Ray Bradbury and Stephen King. I'm really keen on horror and sci-fi - even better if they're connected. I read a lot. If I coded as much as I read, I would be sitting now in my newly built house on Ibiza :D </p>
<p>Last but not least, I love the nature. Hiking is my second life. In May (2024) I start the course that will give me opportunity to be a mountine-guide in Polish mountains - Beskidy. Keep fingers crossed for me. And I hope see you soon on your routes.</p>
